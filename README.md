Electrobalance LLC specializes in the development of systems for increasing the range of electric public transport operating on batteries (electric buses, electric LCVs etc.).

The company develops systems, algorithms and software for optimal control of traction motors, aiming to maximize the share of recuperated kinetic energy dissipated during the breaking.
Our algorithms account for the specifics of the real driving cycle of electric transport.

The company also runs R&D consulting projects in the field of optimal choice of combination of traction motor + control + energy storage capacity for electric transportation under specifics of client operating conditions.

Electrobalance LLC engineers often participate at scientific conferences and tech talks. Here are [proceedings](https://github.com/Electrobalance/Electrobalance/files/14782020/_.pdf) from talk by lead-engineer Alexey Arbuzov at 'Electrotrans 2023' International Conference held in September-2023.
